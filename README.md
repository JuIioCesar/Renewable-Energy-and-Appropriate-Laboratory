:chart_with_upwards_trend: Berkeley Internship Application

Jupiter notebook [Julio Cesar](http://github.com/juiiocesar) used to apply to an intership at the [Renewable Energy and Appropriate Laboratory](https://rael.berkeley.edu). 
He got accepted but had to decline the offer due to lack of economic support from Berkeley to non-students.
